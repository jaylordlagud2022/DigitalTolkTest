=======What Makes It Amazing=======

Proper use of Laravel Eloquent relationships and methods (find, with, whereIn, pluck, sortBy) enhances readability and performance.

Role-Based Logic:
The conditional logic based on the user's role (customer or translator) is appropriate and reflects a common pattern in role-based systems.

Code Organization:
The code is organized into logical sections, making it easy to follow the flow of execution.

Use of Constants:
The use of constant values (['pending', 'assigned', 'started']) enhances code maintainability by centralizing status definitions.

==========What Makes It Terrible===========
Lack of Comments:

Absence of comments may hinder understanding, especially for developers who are new to the codebase or when revisiting the code after a period.

Potential for N+1 Query Issue:

Depending on the size of the dataset, there might be a risk of the N+1 query problem, especially when fetching jobs along with related data. However, this depends on the specifics of the Eloquent relationships.

// Initial query to fetch jobs
$jobs = Job::all();

// N+1 queries for related data (e.g., user associated with each job)
foreach ($jobs as $job) {
    $user = $job->user; // Additional query for each job
}

In the example above, if there are 10 jobs, the initial query fetches those 10 jobs, but then, for each job, an additional query is executed to retrieve the associated user. This results in a total of 11 queries (1 initial query + 10 additional queries).

The N+1 query problem can lead to significant performance issues, especially when dealing with large datasets. It's often more efficient to use eager loading mechanisms provided by ORMs to fetch related data in a single query rather than incurring multiple queries.

In Laravel's Eloquent ORM, the with method is commonly used for eager loading. For example:

// Eager loading related data (user) to avoid N+1 queries
$jobs = Job::with('user')->get();


No Error Handling:
The code assumes that finding a user and fetching jobs will always succeed. Adding error handling would make the code more robust, especially for database queries.

Magic Strings:

The comparison $jobitem->immediate == 'yes' relies on a magic string. It would be more robust to use boolean values or constants.

Inconsistent Naming:

The variable $noramlJobs contains a typo. It should be $normalJobs for consistency.

While the code is relatively clear, consider adding comments for any complex logic or to explain the purpose of the function.
In summary, the code seems well-written and functional. Any further improvements could be minor refinements based on personal preferences or specific project requirements.

Kindly review the comments and code refactoring I've done in the BookingController.php and BookingRepository.php files.

e.g
BookingRepository.php 
store method 

The refactoring divides the logic into smaller, more manageable methods, enhancing readability and maintainability. Additionally, comments have been added to elucidate the purpose of each method and the overall flow of the store method.


====Unit test====
I've included a feature test for the following:

3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate
